## <a name="page_01" class="page-number">1.0</a> Mercenary Pack General Rules

**Can I rename these characters?** Yes, of course. While they are ‘officially’ existing characters, you can rename them and make them your own.

**What does ‘as if you occupied’ mean?** Several classes in this pack (including Anaphi and Cassandra) have cards featuring this effect. All parts of the ability must be performed as if your figure was on the chosen hex, including situational buffs. They cannot just be performed from your own figure. Your figure does not need line of sight to the chosen hex, or to the ability’s targets. If there’s a pull or push as part of the ability, it’s measured from the hex, not your figure. Retaliate will only affect you if your actual figure is in range of the enemy’s Retaliate range.

**When are these characters unlocked?** These are considered Starter Classes, and are available immediately, unless you decide otherwise.

**Which games can these characters be used in** Mercenary Pack characters are compatible with any game in the series. They have a QR code which will lead you to rules that may not appear in the characters' boxes. Their solo scenarios, however, require the characters' "home" game components - Jaws of the Lion for Anaphi; Gloomhaven Second Edition for Hail and Cassandra; and Frosthaven for Satha.

### <a name="page_02">1.1</a> Anaphi

**Surrounding Shadows (1) – What does ‘as if I occupied’ mean here?** See general rules, above.

**Endless Biting (1) – What happens if the Duskrat Swarm is reduced to 0 health by an Attack? Can it still Heal 1?**  No; it is killed when it has accumulated damage equal to its health.

**Black Claws (1)** – Note that the enemy has to have a negative condition before you initate the attack ability, in order to get the additional target.

**Level 5 Cards General** – As both of Anaphi's lvl 5 cards use the second mini, she cannot have both cards in her active area at the same time. (You're meant to choose one and not pick the other card at higher levels.)

**My Loyal Friend (5) – What does the added text mean here?** Damage on Summons is normally tracked by placing damage tokens on their card. When damage tokens equal to the summon’s maximum health are present, the Summon dies and usually the card is removed. Rosie works slightly differently than normal Summons, however; for one thing, you don’t remove her card when she dies. For another, her special rules allow you to – effectively – re-summon her at the start of your third turn after she dies. (You don’t gain any more XP for this re-summoning.)
**What happens if there is no hex adjacent to me for the Mind-linked Rat to be re-summoned?** The card text reads ‘may,’ so it may be held until the start of any turn you wish, once all damage tokens are removed. 

**Revel in Misery (6, top)** - Note that the enemy has to have a negative condition before you initate the attack ability, in order to get the bless. Also note that you get a maximum of one Bless per attack ability, not per individual attack.

**Her Highness (9, bot)** – If the Heal targets you, enemies adjacent to you still only take damage once.

### <a name="page_03">1.2</a> Cassandra

**Do 'revealed cards' include drawn cards or discards?** No; only cards that have been flipped to their faces on top of the draw deck are considered 'revealed.'

**Envision the Course (1, top) – What is a ‘linked hex’?** Linked hexes are considered adjacent for the purpose of movement . There is no line-of-sight between linked hexes, but figures can find focus through linked hexes.

**Otherworldly Journey (1, bot)** – Note that a figure cannot be teleported into a hex it could not normally occupy (like an Obstacle for a non-flying enemy.)

**Dimensional Divide (2, top)** – If the element is consumed, the Push is added only to the Push, and the Pull is added only to the Pull.

**Enfeebling Hex (4, top) – How long does the -1 stay in the monster deck?** Until the end of the scenario.

**Tear Reality (7, top) – What does ‘as if you occupied’ mean?** See General Rules, above.

### <a name="page_04">1.3</a> Hail

**General, on Enhancement Costs** – Cards that are conditionally Lost cards (such as Fleeting Interest, 1 top) cost half to enhance.

**Somewhere to Be (1, top)** – Note that teleporting other figures is considered forced movement, and therefore requires line of sight. You cannot teleport a figure into a hex that it is illegal for them to occupy.

**Abundant Nuisance (X, bot) – What happens with Poison while Hail has this Irritation active?** Poison still blocks healing, but is not removed after doing so.

**Trial and Success (X, top) – If I make this a multi-target attack, can I get more than one +1 out of it?** Yes; you get to add a +1 for each enemy killed. If you kill one enemy as part of a multi-target attack, you will get the +1 sticker before attacking the next enemy.

**Trying to Remember (5, top)** – You can only gain a Curse once when this action is played.

**Kill That One First (8, top) – Can I skip the Strengthen on the enemy?** No. If you choose to perform a non-mandatory ability, you must perform the entirety of the ability. (See the GH2e rulebook, pg 35.)

**Closed for Business (8, bot)** – Note that the enemy has already ended their move ability adjacent to you. If you push them away from you, making them out of range, they cannot choose to move more, or refocus on a different enemy.

**Perk: Minor Imbuement** – Note that “Hail gains 1 resolve” on the monster modifier card is considered a positive effect with unknown value for the monsters. This can affect the card chosen with advantage or disadvantage.

**Perk: Enchanter** The 5 gold reduction is applied at the very end of calculating enhancement costs.

### <a name="page_05">1.4</a> Satha

**Stand Firm (2, top)** – The bonus being ‘cumulative’ means that you gain Shield 1 for each attack, stacking the final value. So if you are attacked four times, you will have Shield 1 on the first one from this action, all the way up to Shield 4 for the fourth. This additional shield lasts for the rest of the round.

**Armory (5, top)** – Unlike (so far) every other use slot ability in the game, advancing this one is voluntary (that is, it has a trigger condition with ‘you may’ and a result of ‘any number of slots). You may choose to advance it 0 slots on an attack.

**Send them Reeling (7, bot)** – This usually cannot include shields gained from items, because those are (generally) momentary for one attack. It can, however, include round-long or persistent shields, such as from Stand Firm (2, top).

## <a name="page_20">2.0</a> ConQuests

**What if I draw a ConQuest and don't meet the Prosperity requirement?** There's no need to add ConQuests to the available pool before you reach Prosperity 5. If you've already added them to your pool but don't meet the requirements, simply draw again.

**Can ConQuests be completed with Inspiration?** Yes, but if a ConQuest is completed with Inspiration there is no specific character considered to have completed the Personal Quest, so no one would earn the associated lineage reward (although you would still gain prosperity and unlock envelopes as normal).

**Conquer Your Demons** - Note that to succeed in this PQ, you must spawn at least two of every kind of standard demon available in the relevant box. For Gloomhaven 2e and Frosthaven, this is all six elemental demons, plus chaos demons.

**Consequences of Combat** - The self-strengthen is applied after the attack is completely resolved.

## <a name="page_10" class="page-number">3.0</a> Compatibility Notes for Crossover Characters

### General Note - Loot vs Money Tokens

If a mechanic refers to loot tokens or money tokens, it can refer to either, based on what exists in the campaign. Any time you are supposed to return a Frosthaven loot token to a scenario, you must also place one of your loot cards (except for the random item) back to the top of the loot deck.

### Objectives vs. Obstacles with Hit Points

Any mechanic referring to either objectives, or obstacles with hit points, is referring to either.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### Frosthaven characters in Gloomhaven: Second Edition and Jaws of the Lion

**General** - Make note of the event cards rule for Frosthaven Crossover Classes on pg 57 of the rulebook. If the name of a Frosthaven ancestry (Algox, Lurker, or Unfettered) appears anywhere in the narrative text of an event card, that card features a crossover outcome. If you are playing the matching ancestry, you may read the crossover outcome by referencing section XX.1, where XX is the event number (either city or road). Event cards that do not feature crossover outcomes are resolved normally.

**Drifter** - Your Scavenger perk (which lets you exchange Loot Cards) has no function in games without a Loot Deck.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### Gloomhaven: Second Edition characters in Frosthaven

**Silent Knife** - See the General Note at the top of this section for rules involving money vs. loot tokens. Any specific references to gold are unchanged.

**Tinkerer** - It is impossible for this FAQ to encompass all the potential interactions with Chimeric Formula, *particularly* when involving characters from other games. Your group is empowered to interpret ambiguity for your own table. If you are not confident in your group's capability to fairly interpret potentially contradictory rules, I would recommend only using this on simpler cards and avoiding broken interactions.

**Saw and Frosthaven Building 42** - <span class="hidden">Your Devout perk will work just as normal for the Temple, once it is built. Even though the cost for blessings is different between the games, you don't get any refunds.</span>

**Saw and Drifter** - <span class="hidden">Drifter's abilities which move tokens backwards will not work on any Prescriptions Saw gives to them, because Prescriptions are still considered Saw's abilities.</span>

**Three Spears** - <span class="hidden">Items without gold costs may not be refreshed with Supplies. As a house rule recommendation, you may treat potions that are both in Frosthaven and Gloomhaven: Second Edition as having the Gloomhaven version's gold cost. Note that your "Well-Connected" perk (involving faction items) has no function outside of Gloomhaven: Second Edition.</span>

### Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion characters in other games

Crossover character sheets can be found at [Cephalofair's website](https://cephalofair.com/pages/frosthaven). They are technically for Frosthaven, but will work for Gloomhaven: Second Edition as well.

**Demolitionist** - If you bring the Demolitionist into other games, and use the Level X Rubble card, you will need to bring destruction tokens over as well. When you (and only you) destroy any obstacle through items or abilities, place a destruction token in the hex(es) it previously occupied. Hexes with only destruction tokens are considered featureless, and the destruction token should be removed if a new overlay is placed in its hex.
